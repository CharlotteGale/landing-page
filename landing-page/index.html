            <h2 id="about">ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
                From my very first encounter with Python, I was hooked. That first <code>print("Hello World")</code> sucked me in and I haven't looked back since.<br>
                After that, I dived whole-heartedly into a self-taught journey. Learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a bit of SQL and a little bit more Python, from online resources such as freeCodeCamp.<br>
                My passion and dedication eventually led me to applying for, and successfully enrolling, in the Full-Stack Developer nano-degree with Code First Girls.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this intensive 16 week course, my skills were honed with JavaScript, my knowledge built up with SQL and soon enough I was introduced into other frameworks and languages.<br>
                I learnt Express.js, Node.js, Jest, React and a few more tools. I familiarised myself with the command line, growing ever more impressed with Git as Version Control.<br>
                I soon realised that I was a bit more comfortable on the backend, relishing in API and database builds.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, whilst I am more comfortable in the backend, that doesn't mean I don't want to hone my frontend skills, to fully appreciate libraries such as React, tools such as Redux.<br>
                I want to learn as much as I can and grow as a Full-Stack developer.
